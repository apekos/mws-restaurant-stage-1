## Description

This is a project about restaurants and their reviews. The goal was to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert it to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use and also add a service worker for offline experience for users. 

## Run

1. Download the zip file or clone via Github.

2. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`. For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
